# Hangman Game Pair Programming

## Rules:

The rules are simple:

- This is a pair programming exercise
- You can discuss amongst each other how to approach solving the game
- ONLY 1 LAPTOP to be open at all times
- You CANNOT code out your own idea, you must walk your partner through coding it out
- You may use online resources on how to perform specific actions, BUT NO GOOGLING HANGMAN SOLUTIONS

There is some starter code to get you going to speed up the process. You should not need to change anything with regards to what is already there but you may need to add in extra HTML. The game setup has been created for you, however as it is right now will not work, especially the form, so you will need to look at how to make this work.

- When you start a new game, you will need to assign the number of guesses left on the page.
- You will need to create the logic to check the letter guess and fill them in on the displayed dashes.
- You will also need to display the guessed letters to the user. HINT: use `<li>` to show the user.
- Everytime they make a guess the number of guesses should reduce. But if they repeat a letter they have used before should it still reduce the guesses left or no?
- If the user runs out of moves, how should I notify them?
- If the user wins the game within the amount of moves, how should I notify them?

BONUS:

- If you have time, why not try to recreate displaying the hanging man to user instead of displaying just the number of guesses remaining.
